## On-Policy Learning

In on-policy learning, the agent learns the value of the policy being carried out by the agent itself, including the exploration steps. Essentially, the policy used to make decisions is the same policy that is being evaluated and improved. This means the learning process directly depends on the actions taken by the policy.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Data Dependency: On-policy methods rely on the data generated by the current policy to update and improve it.
- Exploration and Exploitation: These methods need to balance exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (using known information) within the same policy. This often requires methods like ε-greedy (where ε gradually decreases) to ensure sufficient exploration.
  **Examples:**
- SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action): In SARSA, the update of the value function depends on the current state (S), the action taken (A), the reward received (R), the next state (S'), and the next action (A') that is taken according to the current policy.
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) are also typically implemented as on-policy algorithms.

## Off-Policy Learning

Off-policy learning, on the other hand, allows the agent to learn from actions that are outside the current policy, including past policies or even hypothetical ones. This means the policy that is being improved (target policy) can be different from the policy used to generate the data (behavior policy).

**Key Characteristics:**

- Greater Flexibility: Off-policy methods can learn from old data (from previous policies) or data collected by other policies. This can make these methods more efficient as they can reuse data.
- Decoupled Exploration and Exploitation: The policy used to generate data (behavior policy) can focus on exploration, while the learning can focus on exploiting the gathered knowledge to improve a different (target) policy.
  **Examples:**
- Q-learning: Here, the update rule uses the maximum reward that would be obtained by taking the best action according to the current Q-table, regardless of the action that was actually taken according to the behavior policy.
- Deep Q-Network (DQN): An extension of Q-learning that uses deep learning to approximate the Q-function.

### Comparison and Implications

- Efficiency: Off-policy methods are generally considered more sample efficient because they can potentially learn from a wide range of data, not just from the trials currently being executed. They can learn from experiences gathered under different conditions and policies.
- Complexity in Implementation: Off-policy learning can be more complex to implement and understand because it involves maintaining a distinction between the behavior policy and the target policy.
- Suitability: On-policy methods are simpler in terms of concept and often easier to tune and debug because the feedback loop between policy execution and policy improvement is more straightforward.
